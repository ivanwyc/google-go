This directory contains a simple example of how one might
start Go running on bare hardware. There is currently code
for 386 and arm.


386

It is very primitive but can run go/test/sieve.go, the concurrent
prime sieve, on a uniprocessor.  It has only been tested using the
Bochs emulator.

To run, first build the tools by running all.bash with GOARCH=386
and GOOS set to your normal GOOS (linux, darwin).  Then:

	export GOOS=tiny
	cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/runtime
	make clean
	make install
	cd tiny
	8g $GOROOT/test/sieve.go
	8l sieve.8
	8l -a sieve.8 >sieve.asm	# can consult sieve.asm for debugging
	dd if=/dev/zero of=disk count=10000
	cat bootblock 8.out | dd of=disk conv=notrunc
	bochs

You may have to tweak the .bochsrc depending on your system,
and you may need to install the Bochs emulator.


ARM

First build the toolchain using GOARCH=arm and GOOS=linux. When
you build your embedded code set GOARCH=tiny.

	export GOOS=tiny
	cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/runtime
	make clean
	make install

On arm the tiny runtime doesn't define a low level write function. You can either
define a stub if you don't need debug output, or more usefully, define it to
print to some debug serial port. Here is a sample function that prints to
the DBGU on an at91sam7s:

#define DBGU_CSR  ((uint32*)   0xFFFFF214) // (DBGU) Channel Status Register
#define US_TXRDY        ((uint32) 0x1 <<  1) // (DBGU) TXRDY Interrupt
#define DBGU_THR  ((uint32*)   0xFFFFF21C) // (DBGU) Transmitter Holding Register

int32
write(int32 fd, void* b, int32 n)
{
	uint32 i;
	uint8* s = (uint8*)b;

	for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		while ((*DBGU_CSR & US_TXRDY) == 0) {
		}
		*DBGU_THR = *s;
		s++;
	}
	return n;
}
