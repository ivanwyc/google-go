// This file implements runtime support for signal handling.
//
// Most synchronization primitives are not available from
// the signal handler (it cannot block and cannot use locks)
// so the handler communicates with a processing goroutine
// via struct sig, below.
//
// Ownership for sig.Note passes back and forth between
// the signal handler and the signal goroutine in rounds.
// The initial state is that sig.note is cleared (setup by siginit).
// At the beginning of each round, mask == 0.
// The round goes through three stages:
//
// (In parallel)
// 1a) One or more signals arrive and are handled
// by sigsend using cas to set bits in sig.mask.
// The handler that changes sig.mask from zero to non-zero
// calls notewakeup(&sig).
// 1b) Sigrecv calls notesleep(&sig) to wait for the wakeup.
//
// 2) Having received the wakeup, sigrecv knows that sigsend
// will not send another wakeup, so it can noteclear(&sig)
// to prepare for the next round. (Sigsend may still be adding
// signals to sig.mask at this point, which is fine.)
//
// 3) Sigrecv uses cas to grab the current sig.mask and zero it,
// triggering the next round.
//
// The signal handler takes ownership of the note by atomically
// changing mask from a zero to non-zero value. It gives up
// ownership by calling notewakeup. The signal goroutine takes
// ownership by returning from notesleep (caused by the notewakeup)
// and gives up ownership by clearing mask.
