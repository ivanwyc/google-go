This is a simple block stacking game, a port of Plan 9's
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/games">games/5s</a>
<br><br>
To play using the keyboard:
as the blocks fall, the <i>a</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>f</i> keys
move the block left, rotate the block left, rotate the block right,
anad move the block right, respectively.
To drop a block, type the space key.
<b>You may need to click on the game window to 
focus the keyboard on it.</b>
<br><br>
To play using the mouse:
as the blocks fall, moving the mouse horizontally positions
the block; left or right clicks rotate the block left or right.
A middle click drops the block.
(Unfortunately, some environments seem to intercept
the middle click before it gets to Native Client.)
<br><br>
To pause the game, type <i>z</i>, <i>p</i>, or the escape key.
