<!-- Roadmap -->

<h2 id="Roadmap">Go Roadmap</h2>

This page lists features and ideas being developed or discussed by the
Go team.  This list will be updated as work continues.

<p>
The roadmap should be discussed on
the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts">golang-nuts
mailing list</a>.

<h3 id="Language_roadmap">
Language roadmap</h3>

<p>
This is a list of language changes that are being considered.
Appearance on this list is no guarantee that the change will be
accepted.

<ul>
<li>
Adjust and simplify semicolon rules.
<li>
Adjust definition of <code>...</code> in parameter lists.
<li>
Add explicit conversions from <code>string</code>
to <code>[]byte</code> and <code>[]int</code>.
<li>
Possibly rewrite restriction on goto across variable declarations.
<li>
Variant types.  A way to define a type as being the union of some set
of types.
<li>
Possibly provide a method that will be run by the garbage
collector when an item is freed.
<li>
Generics.  An active topic of discussion.
<li>
Exceptions.  An active topic of discussion.
</ul>

<h3 id="Implementation_roadmap">
Implementation roadmap</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Improved garbage collector, most likely a reference counting collector
with a cycle detector running in a separate core.
<li>
Debugger.
<li>
Native Client (NaCl) support.
<li>
App Engine support.
<li>
Improved CGO including some mechanism for calling back from C to Go.
<li>
SWIG support.
<li>
Public continuous build and benchmark infrastructure.
<li>
Improved implementation documentation.
<li>
Package manager, possibly including a language change to the import
statement.
</ul>

<h4 id="Gc_roadmap">
Gc compiler roadmap</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Method expressions.
<li>
Implement goto restrictions.
<li>
Safe compilation mode: generate code which is guaranteed not to obtain
an invalid memory address other than via <code>import "unsafe"</code>.
<li>
Generate ELF debug info.
<li>
Improved optimization.
<li>
5g: Better floating point support.
</ul>

<h4 id = "Gccgo_roadmap">
Gccgo compiler roadmap</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Method expressions.
<li>
Implement goto restrictions.
<li>
Implement garbage collection.
<li>
Use goroutines rather than threads.
<li>
Separate gcc interface from frontend proper.
<li>
Use escape analysis to keep more data on stack.
</ul>
