There is one language change: the ability to convert a string to []byte or 
[]int.  This deprecates the strings.Bytes and strings.Runes functions.
You can convert your existing sources using these gofmt commands:
	gofmt -r 'strings.Bytes(x) -> []byte(x)' -w file-or-directory-list
	gofmt -r 'strings.Runes(x) -> []int(x)' -w file-or-directory-list
After running these you might need to delete unused imports of the "strings" 
package.

Other changes and fixes:
* 6l/8l/5l: add -r option
* 8g: make a[byte(x)] truncate x
* codereview.py: fix for compatibility with hg >=1.4.3
* crypto/blowfish: new package (thanks Raif S. Naffah)
* dashboard: more performance tuning
* fmt: use String method in %q to get the value to quote.
* gofmt: several cosmetic changes
* http: fix handling of Connection: close, bug in http.Post
* net: correct DNS configuration,
	fix network timeout boundary condition,
	put [ ] around IPv6 addresses for Dial.
* path: add Match,
	fix bug in Match with non-greedy stars (thanks Kevin Ballard)
* strings: delete Bytes, Runes (see above)
* tests: an Eratosthenesque concurrent prime sieve (thanks Anh Hai Trinh)

<h3 id="2010-01-27">2010-01-27</h3>

<pre>
There are two small language changes: the meaning of chan <- chan int
is now defined, and functions returning functions do not need to 
parenthesize the result type.

There is one significant implementation change: the compilers can
handle multiple packages using the same name in a single binary.
In the gc compilers, this comes at the cost of ensuring that you
always import a particular package using a consistent import path.
In the gccgo compiler, the cost is that you must use the -fgo-prefix
flag to pass a unique prefix (like the eventual import path).

<h3 id="2009-12-22">2009-12-22</h3>

Since the last release there has been one large syntactic change to
the language, already discussed extensively on this list: semicolons
are now implied between statement-ending tokens and newline characters.
See http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/t/5ee32b588d10f2e9 for
details.

By default, gofmt now parses and prints the new lighter weight syntax.
To convert programs written in the old syntax, you can use:

	gofmt -oldparser -w *.go

Since everything was being reformatted anyway, we took the opportunity to
change the way gofmt does alignment.  Now gofmt uses tabs at the start
of a line for basic code alignment, but it uses spaces for alignment of
interior columns.  Thus, in an editor with a fixed-width font, you can
choose your own tab size to change the indentation, and no matter what
tab size you choose, columns will be aligned properly.


In addition to the syntax and formatting changes, there have been many
smaller fixes and updates:

6g,8g,5g: many bug fixes, better registerization,
   build process fix involving mkbuiltin (thanks Yongjian Xu),
   method expressions for concrete types
8l: support for Windows PE files (thanks Hector Chu)

    installation of .so to non-standard locations

encoding/binary: support for slices of fixed-size values (thanks Maxim Ushakov)
exp/vector: experimental alternate vector representation (thanks Jan Mercl)
fmt: %p for chan, map, slice types
gob: a couple more bug fixes
http: support for basic authentication (thanks Ivan Krasin)
image/jpeg: basic JPEG decoder
math: correct handling of Inf and NaN in Pow (thanks Charles Dorian)
misc/bash: completion file for bash (thanks Alex Ray)

Since the last release there are two changes to the language: 

* new builtin copy(dst, src) copies n = min(len(dst), len(src)) 
  elements to dst from src and returns n.  It works correctly

      gofmt -w -r 'bytes.Copy(d, s) -&gt; copy(d, s)' *.go
